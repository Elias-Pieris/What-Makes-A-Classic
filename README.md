# What Makes a Classic? Text Analysis of Books

This project analyses a selection of classic and non-classic books from Project Gutenberg to explore linguistic and stylistic differences, with the goal of understanding what might contribute to a book being considered a "classic." The classics chosen are widely labelled as such whereas the non-classics are those often considered 'forgotten' and have significantly less downloads on the Project Gutenberg website.

## Overview

The analysis includes:

- Cleaning and preprocessing text files from Project Gutenberg.
- Calculating metrics such as:
  - Average word length
  - Average sentence length
  - Vocabulary richness (unique and rare words)
- Visualising results through bar charts and Word Clouds
- Comparing classic books with non-classics to identify patterns in writing style.

## Key Findings

- There are **few noticeable differences between classics and non-classics**, and there is a wide range of metrics across individual books within both categories.  
- Some trends observed in classics that could contribute to popularity:
  - **Shorter sentences** â€” may make the text easier to read.
  - **Moderate word length and vocabulary richness**.
  - Dialogue patterns vary but are generally accessible.
- Many differences are likely due to **specific author style** rather than category.  


## Conclusion

The analysis shows that while certain stylistic features may contribute to readability and appeal, the **status of a book as a classic is likely determined by broader cultural and historical factors**, not just linguistic properties.
